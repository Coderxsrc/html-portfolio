<H1>My favorite movies</H1>
<H2>My top 3 movies of all time</H2>
<hr/>
<p>Boy this is a difficult one because I am sure there is a lot more than
just 3 movies. So I will just try my best here.</p>
<br/>
<H3>1. The Departed</H3>
<p>Well, the acting in this movie is on another level. Just the names of 
the stars can hook you well. Leo, Jack, but most notably in my 
opinion was Mark whalberg.</p>
<br/>
<H3>2. The Prestige</H3>
<p>This one is one of my favorites simply because of the twist at
the end. I felt like Nolan is grinningly saying"Gotcha" very loudly.</p>
<br/>
<H3>3. The Bourne Supremacy</H3>
<p>Action Action and more Action. A movie that can make you gasp so
many times. Had fun really watching it.</p>
